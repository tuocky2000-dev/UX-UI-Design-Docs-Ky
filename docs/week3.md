# **User Research Basics**

In the third week of Chris's class, we were being able to learn about new things about our users like creating personas, user stories and user scenarios.

Down here are details:

## **Personas**

In start of the lecture, we worked in groups to create 2 personas about random people in images that created by AI.

The persona contained name, age, job, needs and goals, Pain Points, Characteristics, Behaviors. These personas are users who are interested in our Magic Stronghold website that we wanted to rebuild.

To be more detailed:

- *Name*: The name of a person.
- *Age*: The age of a person.
- *Job*: The job of a person.
- *Needs & Goals*: What are the purposes and needs of that person toward our websites.
- *Pain Points*: Frustrations and problems of a person has when using our website.
- *Characteristics*: Traits and qualities that describe how the user typically thinks or interacts with websites.
- *Behaviors*: The user’s common actions and habits when browsing the site, such as how they search for products, how often they visit, what device they use, and how they make purchase decisions.

## **User Stories**

After the bulding personas activity, we moved on to the creating user stories in the same group. A user story is a short, simple description of a feature told from the perspective of the user. It follows a common format:

*“As a [type of user], I want to [perform an action] so that I can [achieve a goal].”*

These stories help us understand what users actually want to do on the website and why those actions matter. They also guide the development process by keeping the focus on user needs rather than assumptions.

Examples related to Magic Stronghold might include:

- As a TCG collector, I want the website not to be too cluttered and hard to navigate.
- As a broke collector, I want to see the latest deals as soon as possible, so I can buy them first.
- As a TCG collector, I want a homepage section that highlights trending or newly added products.

User stories keep the project grounded in real user motivations and help prioritize features.

## **User Scenarios**

After the bulding user stories activity, we moved on to the creating user scenarios in the same group as before. User scenarios expand on user stories by describing a more detailed narrative of how a user interacts with the website. They outline the context, the user’s goal, and the steps they take to achieve it.

Scenarios help us visualize the user journey and identify potential friction points. An example related to Magic Stronghold might look like:

"As a TCG collector, I want a homepage section that highlights trending or newly added products.
Start at the home page
-> Look at the list on the left.
  -> Find the New Items section.
     -> Go to the New Items section and see all the Newest Items in 48."

Scenarios like this help us understand the user’s environment, emotions, and challenges, which leads to better design decisions.
