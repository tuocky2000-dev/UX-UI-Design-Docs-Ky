# **Usability Factors & Methodology**

In the second week of Chris’s class, we learned about the 7 usability factors and the 5 stages of methodology, and we also did two in‑class activities to help us understand how these concepts apply to real products and real situations.

Down here are the details of what we covered and what I took away from the lesson:

## **7 usability factors**

We learned about the 7 usability factors that help designers evaluate whether a product truly meets user needs, and these factors basically act as the core principles that shape a strong user experience.

Here are the seven factors we talked about:

- *Useful*: the product should actually solve a real problem, like a weather app giving accurate forecasts.
- *Usable*: people should be able to navigate it easily with clear interactions and simple forms.
- *Findable*: users should be able to locate what they need quickly through things like search bars or clear menus.
- *Credible*: the information and the company behind the product should feel trustworthy.
- *Desirable*: the design and visuals should create a positive emotional response.
- *Accessible*: the product should work for people with different abilities, using things like alt text and proper color contrast.
- *Valuable*: it should benefit both the user and the organization.

Together, these seven factors help determine whether a product is truly effective

## **5 stages of methodology**

We also learned about the five‑stage design thinking methodology, which helps ensure users have the best experience when they come to our website.
The stages are Empathize, Define, Ideate, Prototype, and Test.

Each stage builds on the previous one, starting with understanding users and their pain points, then defining the problem clearly, generating ideas, creating prototypes, and finally testing those ideas with real users.

Every stage focuses on understanding users deeply and improving the design based on their needs.
Here’s a quick breakdown:

- *Empathize*: understand users and their struggles.
- *Define*: narrow down the real problem.
- *Ideate*: come up with possible solutions.
- *Prototype*: create a basic version of the idea.
- *Test*: try it with real users and gather feedback.

## **2 in‑class activities**

### Activity 1

For the first activity, we had to find one example of a product or service that fits the 7 usability factors and one that doesn’t. We chose ChatGPT as the example that fits the usability factors well because it’s easy to navigate, responsive, and gives clear feedback. The interface is simple, the layout is consistent, and users can accomplish tasks without confusion.

On the other hand, we chose Vietjet as the example that does not fit the usability factors. The main issue is the constant flight delays, which create a frustrating and unreliable experience. Even if the website itself works fine, the overall service fails important usability principles like reliability, user satisfaction, and meeting user expectations.

### Activity 2

The second activity was about defining a problem and finding a solution using the 5 stages of methodology. The situation we were given was about a prospective student who wants to enroll in BCIT but can’t, and we had to come up with our own example. I wrote about a student who wants to study computer science at BCIT but is being forced by their parents to pursue a career like law or medicine instead.

This reflects a common issue where many prospective students can’t choose BCIT because of their parents’ expectations. For the solution, I suggested raising awareness among older generations about job choices and encouraging them to give younger people more freedom to choose their own paths.

For the prototype, I came up with the idea of a Family Career Counseling Program where a professional advisor meets with students and their parents in a one‑on‑one session to help bridge the gap. To test it, we would run a role‑play session with a student, a parent, and a career advisor, then gather feedback afterward to improve the program into something more complete.
