# Introduction to the UX/UI Design

HIHIHIHIHIHIHI
This UX/UI Design course guides us through the full process of creating user‑centered digital experiences, from understanding real user needs all the way to designing and refining a final product.

Throughout the term, we explore how good design is built on clear problem‑solving, thoughtful structure, and meaningful interaction, rather than just visuals. Each week adds a new layer to the process, helping us see how research, planning, creativity, and testing all connect together.

We learn how to define problems properly, understand our users through personas and scenarios, organize information with strong navigation, and generate ideas using different ideation techniques.

As the course continues, we move into wireframing, prototyping, visual design, accessibility, and user testing, building up the skills needed to redesign a website in a way that feels intuitive and purposeful.

The mix of lectures, hands‑on activities, and group exercises helps us apply every concept directly to real examples, making the learning process more practical and connected.

By the end of the course, we will gain a full understanding of how to approach UX/UI design from start to finish, and how each step contributes to creating a smoother, more meaningful experience for users.

This site documents everything we learned along the way, showing how each topic builds toward our final redesign project.
