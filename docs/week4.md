# **Design Planning**

In the fourth week of Chris's class, we learned about the early stages of the design process. For example, we explored how to define a clear problem statement using the Five Ws, how to identify ideal users, and how to articulate the core issue without jumping into solutions too soon.

From there, we moved into outlining a focused feature list to establish the project’s scope, followed by ideation techniques like brainstorming, Worst Possible Idea, and Crazy 8s to generate a wide range of possibilities.

Moreover, we explored Information Architecture and how organizing content, labelling pages, and structuring navigation which all play a huge role in helping users find what they need. Finally, we practiced this through a group exercise by categorizing links, building menu structures, and applying the concepts directly to real examples.

## **Problem Statements**

In Week 4, we learned how to clearly define a problem by breaking it down using the Five Ws, which helped us understand the purpose behind creating or redesigning a site before jumping into solutions.

We focused on identifying who the ideal users are and what they need, what the site should actually do and where its main focus belongs, where the experience takes place online, when the product is needed or expected to be used, and why the redesign or creation is necessary in the first place.

This framework gave us a clearer view for figuring out the user needs and project goals, making the rest of the design process more smoothly.

## **Feature List**

For the feature list, we are basically outlining what we plan to redesign or implement for the website. This part is meant to list the main features or areas we want to focus on, like updating the branding, adjusting the colors and typography, or improving the layout of certain pages.

It can also include things like redesigning the home page, fixing the menu, or rebuilding specific sections that don’t work well. The idea is just to clearly show what parts of the website we are targeting in the redesign, without going into too much detail yet. It’s more like a simple feature list that sets the direction for what we’re going to work on next.

## **Ideation**

For the ideation stage, the goal is to generate as many possible solutions to the problem as we can, and this part is completely non‑judgemental. It’s all about exploring ideas freely without worrying about whether they’re good or bad yet. We use different techniques to help us think creatively and push past the obvious solutions.

Some of the methods we talked about include:

- Brainstorming: coming up with as many ideas as possible
- Worst Possible Idea: intentionally suggesting bad ideas to break mental blocks
- Crazy 8s: sketching quick wireframe ideas in eight fast rounds

These techniques help us open up our thinking and look at the problem from different angles before narrowing anything down.

## **Information Architecture**

For Information Architecture, we focused on how content is organized and labelled so users can actually find what they’re looking for. Information Architecture is made up of several systems that work together to create a clear structure for the website.

One part is navigation, which includes deciding what type of menu to use, how many menus there should be, and how the hierarchy works. The hierarchy can be deep, where there are only a few top‑level links but a lot of links underneath, or shallow, where there are many top‑level links with fewer links below them.

Another system is labelling, which is about choosing the style of language we use for menu items and page names. We also looked at content inventory, which is basically listing out all the pages and content the website has, and from that, creating a sitemap that visually shows how everything connects.

The last part is wireframes, which are simple line drawings that show the layout of menus and pages before any real design work happens.

All of these systems together help shape how users move through the site and how easy it is for them to understand the structure.

## **Group Exercise**

For this part of the exercise, the instructor gave us the top‑level menu headings, and our job was just to categorize all the links underneath them. We didn’t create the headings ourselves. We only had to decide which items fit best under each one.

Based on that, we organized everything like this:

Shows:

- Current Shows
- Ticket Information
- Venue Information

Get Involved:

- Musical Theatre Camp
- Volunteering
- Audition Info

This was the final grouping our team agreed on, and it made the most sense based on how users would look for information. Hi
