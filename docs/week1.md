# **Website Selection**

In the first week of Chris's class, we were told to assign into groups of our choice or work alone, so me, Derek and Clayton decided to work together and redesign a website called Magic Stronghold Game. At first, we had a lot of ideas and choices for bad websites that need to be improved but we chose this one because of Chris's advices and other considerations.

Down here are the reasons why:

## **Reasons for not choosing other websites:**

We actually have two other websites called 4chan and Craigslist that also have really bad design. The reason we didn’t choose Craigslist is because it’s super hard to redesign, or maybe we would have to rebuild the whole structure from scratch. Craigslist also has way too many categories, which makes it nearly impossible to build a functional navigation bar with a proper menu list.

Another thing we considered is that some users on Craigslist are individuals with limited technological proficiency, so the current design might actually be more beneficial for them. Since it’s mostly plaintext with very few images, it’s simple enough for people who aren’t comfortable with modern interfaces.

For 4chan, we didn’t choose it because it has adult content, and that’s not appropriate for studying purposes. It also has the same problem as Craigslist, where there are too many things going on in the menu list, making the whole layout feel overwhelming and messy.

## **Reasons for choosing Magic Stronghold Game:**

The main reason that we chose this website is because of Clayton's suggestion. It is a website of a real store near his house so it would be great to redesign something that is already familiar with one of our group members. Additionally, it has a specific theme like toys, cards, comics, board games (related to entertainment), so we think it will be more meaningful to redesign it.
