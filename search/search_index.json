Each week adds a new layer to the process, helping us see how research, planning, creativity, and testing all connect together.</p> <p>We learn how to define problems properly, understand our users through personas and scenarios, organize information with strong navigation, and generate ideas using different ideation techniques.</p> <p>As the course continues, we move into wireframing, prototyping, visual design, accessibility, and user testing, building up the skills needed to redesign a website in a way that feels intuitive and purposeful.</p> <p>The mix of lectures, hands\u2011on activities, and group exercises helps us apply every concept directly to real examples, making the learning process more practical and connected.</p> <p>By the end of the course, we will gain a full understanding of how to approach UX/UI design from start to finish, and how each step contributes to creating a smoother, more meaningful experience for users.</p> <p>This site documents everything we learned along the way, showing how each topic builds toward our final redesign project.</p>"},{"location":"week1/","title":"Website Selection","text":"<p>In the first week of Chris's class, we were told to assign into groups of our choice or work alone, so me, Derek and Clayton decided to work together and redesign a website called Magic Stronghold Game. At first, we had a lot of ideas and choices for bad websites that need to be improved but we chose this one because of Chris's advices and other considerations.</p> <p>Down here are the reasons why:</p>"},{"location":"week1/#reasons-for-not-choosing-other-websites","title":"Reasons for not choosing other websites:","text":"<p>We actually have two other websites called 4chan and Craigslist that also have really bad design. The reason we didn\u2019t choose Craigslist is because it\u2019s super hard to redesign, or maybe we would have to rebuild the whole structure from scratch. Craigslist also has way too many categories, which makes it nearly impossible to build a functional navigation bar with a proper menu list.</p> <p>Another thing we considered is that some users on Craigslist are individuals with limited technological proficiency, so the current design might actually be more beneficial for them. Since it\u2019s mostly plaintext with very few images, it\u2019s simple enough for people who aren\u2019t comfortable with modern interfaces.</p> <p>For 4chan, we didn\u2019t choose it because it has adult content, and that\u2019s not appropriate for studying purposes. It also has the same problem as Craigslist, where there are too many things going on in the menu list, making the whole layout feel overwhelming and messy.</p>"},{"location":"week1/#reasons-for-choosing-magic-stronghold-game","title":"Reasons for choosing Magic Stronghold Game:","text":"<p>The main reason that we chose this website is because of Clayton's suggestion. It is a website of a real store near his house so it would be great to redesign something that is already familiar with one of our group members. Additionally, it has a specific theme like toys, cards, comics, board games (related to entertainment), so we think it will be more meaningful to redesign it.</p>"},{"location":"week2/","title":"Usability Factors &amp; Methodology","text":"<p>In the second week of Chris\u2019s class, we learned about the 7 usability factors and the 5 stages of methodology, and we also did two in\u2011class activities to help us understand how these concepts apply to real products and real situations.</p> <p>Down here are the details of what we covered and what I took away from the lesson:</p>"},{"location":"week2/#7-usability-factors","title":"7 usability factors","text":"<p>We learned about the 7 usability factors that help designers evaluate whether a product truly meets user needs, and these factors basically act as the core principles that shape a strong user experience.</p> <p>Here are the seven factors we talked about:</p> <ul> <li>Useful: the product should actually solve a real problem, like a weather app giving accurate forecasts.</li> <li>Usable: people should be able to navigate it easily with clear interactions and simple forms.</li> <li>Findable: users should be able to locate what they need quickly through things like search bars or clear menus.</li> <li>Credible: the information and the company behind the product should feel trustworthy.</li> <li>Desirable: the design and visuals should create a positive emotional response.</li> <li>Accessible: the product should work for people with different abilities, using things like alt text and proper color contrast.</li> <li>Valuable: it should benefit both the user and the organization.</li> </ul> <p>Together, these seven factors help determine whether a product is truly effective</p>"},{"location":"week2/#5-stages-of-methodology","title":"5 stages of methodology","text":"<p>We also learned about the five\u2011stage design thinking methodology, which helps ensure users have the best experience when they come to our website. The stages are Empathize, Define, Ideate, Prototype, and Test.</p> <p>Each stage builds on the previous one, starting with understanding users and their pain points, then defining the problem clearly, generating ideas, creating prototypes, and finally testing those ideas with real users.</p> <p>Every stage focuses on understanding users deeply and improving the design based on their needs. Here\u2019s a quick breakdown:</p> <ul> <li>Empathize: understand users and their struggles.</li> <li>Define: narrow down the real problem.</li> <li>Ideate: come up with possible solutions.</li> <li>Prototype: create a basic version of the idea.</li> <li>Test: try it with real users and gather feedback.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"week2/#2-inclass-activities","title":"2 in\u2011class activities","text":""},{"location":"week2/#activity-1","title":"Activity 1","text":"<p>For the first activity, we had to find one example of a product or service that fits the 7 usability factors and one that doesn\u2019t. We chose ChatGPT as the example that fits the usability factors well because it\u2019s easy to navigate, responsive, and gives clear feedback. The interface is simple, the layout is consistent, and users can accomplish tasks without confusion.</p> <p>On the other hand, we chose Vietjet as the example that does not fit the usability factors. The main issue is the constant flight delays, which create a frustrating and unreliable experience. Even if the website itself works fine, the overall service fails important usability principles like reliability, user satisfaction, and meeting user expectations.</p>"},{"location":"week2/#activity-2","title":"Activity 2","text":"<p>The second activity was about defining a problem and finding a solution using the 5 stages of methodology. The situation we were given was about a prospective student who wants to enroll in BCIT but can\u2019t, and we had to come up with our own example. I wrote about a student who wants to study computer science at BCIT but is being forced by their parents to pursue a career like law or medicine instead.</p> <p>This reflects a common issue where many prospective students can\u2019t choose BCIT because of their parents\u2019 expectations. For the solution, I suggested raising awareness among older generations about job choices and encouraging them to give younger people more freedom to choose their own paths.</p> <p>For the prototype, I came up with the idea of a Family Career Counseling Program where a professional advisor meets with students and their parents in a one\u2011on\u2011one session to help bridge the gap. To test it, we would run a role\u2011play session with a student, a parent, and a career advisor, then gather feedback afterward to improve the program into something more complete.</p>"},{"location":"week3/","title":"User Research Basics","text":"<p>In the third week of Chris's class, we were being able to learn about new things about our users like creating personas, user stories and user scenarios.</p> <p>Down here are details:</p>"},{"location":"week3/#personas","title":"Personas","text":"<p>In start of the lecture, we worked in groups to create 2 personas about random people in images that created by AI.</p> <p>The persona contained name, age, job, needs and goals, Pain Points, Characteristics, Behaviors. These personas are users who are interested in our Magic Stronghold website that we wanted to rebuild.</p> <p>To be more detailed:</p> <ul> <li>Name: The name of a person.</li> <li>Age: The age of a person.</li> <li>Job: The job of a person.</li> <li>Needs &amp; Goals: What are the purposes and needs of that person toward our websites.</li> <li>Pain Points: Frustrations and problems of a person has when using our website.</li> <li>Characteristics: Traits and qualities that describe how the user typically thinks or interacts with websites.</li> <li>Behaviors: The user\u2019s common actions and habits when browsing the site, such as how they search for products, how often they visit, what device they use, and how they make purchase decisions.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"week3/#user-stories","title":"User Stories","text":"<p>After the bulding personas activity, we moved on to the creating user stories in the same group. A user story is a short, simple description of a feature told from the perspective of the user. It follows a common format:</p> <p>\u201cAs a [type of user], I want to [perform an action] so that I can [achieve a goal].\u201d</p> <p>These stories help us understand what users actually want to do on the website and why those actions matter. They also guide the development process by keeping the focus on user needs rather than assumptions.</p> <p>Examples related to Magic Stronghold might include:</p> <ul> <li>As a TCG collector, I want the website not to be too cluttered and hard to navigate.</li> <li>As a broke collector, I want to see the latest deals as soon as possible, so I can buy them first.</li> <li>As a TCG collector, I want a homepage section that highlights trending or newly added products.</li> </ul> <p>User stories keep the project grounded in real user motivations and help prioritize features.</p>"},{"location":"week3/#user-scenarios","title":"User Scenarios","text":"<p>After the bulding user stories activity, we moved on to the creating user scenarios in the same group as before. User scenarios expand on user stories by describing a more detailed narrative of how a user interacts with the website. They outline the context, the user\u2019s goal, and the steps they take to achieve it.</p> <p>Scenarios help us visualize the user journey and identify potential friction points. An example related to Magic Stronghold might look like:</p> <p>\"As a TCG collector, I want a homepage section that highlights trending or newly added products. Start at the home page -&gt; Look at the list on the left.   -&gt; Find the New Items section.      -&gt; Go to the New Items section and see all the Newest Items in 48.\"</p> <p>Scenarios like this help us understand the user\u2019s environment, emotions, and challenges, which leads to better design decisions.</p>"},{"location":"week4/","title":"Design Planning","text":"<p>In the fourth week of Chris's class, we learned about the early stages of the design process. For example, we explored how to define a clear problem statement using the Five Ws, how to identify ideal users, and how to articulate the core issue without jumping into solutions too soon.</p> <p>From there, we moved into outlining a focused feature list to establish the project\u2019s scope, followed by ideation techniques like brainstorming, Worst Possible Idea, and Crazy 8s to generate a wide range of possibilities.</p> <p>Moreover, we explored Information Architecture and how organizing content, labelling pages, and structuring navigation which all play a huge role in helping users find what they need. Finally, we practiced this through a group exercise by categorizing links, building menu structures, and applying the concepts directly to real examples.</p>"},{"location":"week4/#problem-statements","title":"Problem Statements","text":"<p>In Week 4, we learned how to clearly define a problem by breaking it down using the Five Ws, which helped us understand the purpose behind creating or redesigning a site before jumping into solutions.</p> <p>We focused on identifying who the ideal users are and what they need, what the site should actually do and where its main focus belongs, where the experience takes place online, when the product is needed or expected to be used, and why the redesign or creation is necessary in the first place.</p> <p>This framework gave us a clearer view for figuring out the user needs and project goals, making the rest of the design process more smoothly.</p>"},{"location":"week4/#feature-list","title":"Feature List","text":"<p>For the feature list, we are basically outlining what we plan to redesign or implement for the website. This part is meant to list the main features or areas we want to focus on, like updating the branding, adjusting the colors and typography, or improving the layout of certain pages.</p> <p>It can also include things like redesigning the home page, fixing the menu, or rebuilding specific sections that don\u2019t work well. The idea is just to clearly show what parts of the website we are targeting in the redesign, without going into too much detail yet. It\u2019s more like a simple feature list that sets the direction for what we\u2019re going to work on next.</p>"},{"location":"week4/#ideation","title":"Ideation","text":"<p>For the ideation stage, the goal is to generate as many possible solutions to the problem as we can, and this part is completely non\u2011judgemental. It\u2019s all about exploring ideas freely without worrying about whether they\u2019re good or bad yet. We use different techniques to help us think creatively and push past the obvious solutions.</p> <p>Some of the methods we talked about include:</p> <ul> <li>Brainstorming: coming up with as many ideas as possible</li> <li>Worst Possible Idea: intentionally suggesting bad ideas to break mental blocks</li> <li>Crazy 8s: sketching quick wireframe ideas in eight fast rounds</li> </ul> <p>These techniques help us open up our thinking and look at the problem from different angles before narrowing anything down.</p>"},{"location":"week4/#information-architecture","title":"Information Architecture","text":"<p>For Information Architecture, we focused on how content is organized and labelled so users can actually find what they\u2019re looking for. Information Architecture is made up of several systems that work together to create a clear structure for the website.</p> <p>One part is navigation, which includes deciding what type of menu to use, how many menus there should be, and how the hierarchy works. The hierarchy can be deep, where there are only a few top\u2011level links but a lot of links underneath, or shallow, where there are many top\u2011level links with fewer links below them.</p> <p>Another system is labelling, which is about choosing the style of language we use for menu items and page names. We also looked at content inventory, which is basically listing out all the pages and content the website has, and from that, creating a sitemap that visually shows how everything connects.</p> <p>The last part is wireframes, which are simple line drawings that show the layout of menus and pages before any real design work happens.</p> <p>All of these systems together help shape how users move through the site and how easy it is for them to understand the structure.</p>"},{"location":"week4/#group-exercise","title":"Group Exercise","text":"<p>For this part of the exercise, the instructor gave us the top\u2011level menu headings, and our job was just to categorize all the links underneath them. We didn\u2019t create the headings ourselves. We only had to decide which items fit best under each one.</p> <p>Based on that, we organized everything like this:</p> <p>Shows:</p> <ul> <li>Current Shows</li> <li>Ticket Information</li> <li>Venue Information</li> </ul> <p>Get Involved:</p> <ul> <li>Musical Theatre Camp</li> <li>Volunteering</li> <li>Audition Info</li> </ul> <p>Visit Us:</p> <ul> <li>Getting Here</li> <li>Accessibility</li> </ul> <p>Support &amp; Contact:</p> <ul> <li>Join Our Team</li> <li>Contact Us</li> <li>Donate</li> </ul> <p>About:</p> <ul> <li>Our Story</li> <li>Past Shows</li> <li>Visitor Questions (FAQ)</li> </ul> <p>This was the final grouping our team agreed on, and it made the most sense based on how users would look for information.</p>"}]}
